## New Here? Start Here!

**Welcome to the V3 Enterprise Edition.** This isn't just a list of scripts; it's a complete operating system for your AI Agent.

### 1. 🐣 Context: What is this?

AI Agents (like Claude Code, Cursor, or Gemini) are smart, but they lack **specific tools**. They don't know your company's "Deployment Protocol" or the specific syntax for "AWS CloudFormation".
**Skills** are small markdown files that teach them how to do these specific tasks perfectly, every time.

### 2. ⚡️ Quick Start (The "Bundle" Way)

Don't install 250+ skills manually. Use our **Starter Packs**:

1.  **Clone the repo**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills.git .agent/skills
    ```
2.  **Pick your persona** (See [docs/BUNDLES.md](docs/BUNDLES.md)):
    - **Web Dev?** use the `Web Wizard` pack.
    - **Hacker?** use the `Security Engineer` pack.
    - **Just curious?** start with `Essentials`.

### 3. 🧠 How to use

Once installed, just ask your agent naturally:

> "Use the **@brainstorming** skill to help me plan a SaaS."
> "Run **@lint-and-validate** on this file."

👉 **[Read the Full Getting Started Guide](GETTING_STARTED.md)**

> [!WARNING]
> **Windows Users**: This repository uses **symlinks** for official skills.
> You must enable Developer Mode or run Git as Administrator:
> `git clone -c core.symlinks=true https://github.com/...`

Use when building AI agents, designing tool APIs, implementing permission systems, or creating autonomous coding assistants. | `skills/autonomous-agent-patterns` |
| **autonomous-agents** | ⚪ | Autonomous agents are AI systems that can independently decompose goals, plan actions, execute tools, and self-correct without constant human guidance. The challenge isn't making them capable - it's making them reliable. Every extra decision multiplies failure probability.  This skill covers agent loops (ReAct, Plan-Execute), goal decomposition, reflection patterns, and production reliability. Key insight: compounding error rates kill autonomous agents. A 95% success rate per step drops to 60% b | `skills/autonomous-agents` |
| **computer-use-agents** | ⚪ | Build AI agents that interact with computers like humans do - viewing screens, moving cursors, clicking buttons, and typing text. Covers Anthropic's Computer Use, OpenAI's Operator/CUA, and open-source alternatives. Critical focus on sandboxing, security, and handling the unique challenges of vision-based control. Use when: computer use, desktop automation agent, screen control AI, vision-based agent, GUI automation. | `skills/computer-use-agents` |

Orchestrates 100+ specialized agents across engineering, QA, DevOps, security, data/ML, business operations, marketing, HR, and customer success. Takes PRD to fully deployed, revenue-generating product with zero human intervention. Features Task tool for subagent dispatch, parallel code review with 3 specialized reviewers, severity-based issue triage, distributed task queue with dead letter handling, automatic deployment to cloud providers, A/B testing, customer feedback loops, incident response, circuit breakers, and self-healing. Handles rate limits via distributed state checkpoints and auto-resume with exponential backoff. Requires --dangerously-skip-permissions flag. | `skills/loki-mode` |
| **multi-agent-brainstorming** | ⚪ | Use this skill when a design or idea requires higher confidence, risk reduction, or formal review.
